# BlueBerry Wine Project

## Data description
This dataset explores two distinct Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine varietiesâ€”red and white. It provides a comprehensive collection of samples, offering a unique opportunity to delve into the characteristics that define wine quality.

The dataset comprises 1,599 samples of red wine and 4,898 samples of white wine (as in the chart below with the percental distribution), each containing detailed physiochemical information, such as acidity, sugar levels, and alcohol content. In addition to these metrics, the dataset includes quality evaluations performed by wine experts.

The experts graded each wine on a scale from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent), offering a valuable benchmark for understanding the factors that influence wine quality and consumer preference.
This dataset is perfect for data analysis, machine learning, and exploratory research into the science of winemaking. It provides insights into both the quantitative and subjective elements that contribute to the art of crafting exceptional wine.
